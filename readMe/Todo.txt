 1. Expand the gesture database & add samples collected when the wheelchair is in motion.
 2. Better way of handling false positives: gesture capture should not start when the user is motionless.
 3. Distinct audio feedback for each recognized gesture. Text-to-speech or prerecorded.
 4. Is there a need for visual feedback?
 5. Should the program wait for a confirmation gesture before starting motion?
 6. Experiment with new filters.
 7. Program an automatic cross-validation tool changing the random forest parameters dynamically. 
    Currently has to be done manually and recompile between each change.
